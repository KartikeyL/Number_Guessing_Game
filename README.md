# Number_Guessing_Game

In this fun program,a random is generated by the compiler and is guessed by the user.
If the user guesses a number higher than the generated number,then the compiler tells the user to generate a lower number.
If the user guesses a number lower than the generated number,then the compiler tells the user to generate a higher number.
When the user guesses the number correctly, the number of turns taken to guess the number is printed on the screen.
